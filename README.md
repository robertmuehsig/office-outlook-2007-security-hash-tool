# office-outlook-2007-security-hash-tool

If you ever needed to ["Manage trusted add-ins for Outlook"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/office-2010/cc179108(v=office.14)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) you might read something about a "Security hash tool". 

The tool itself is awkward to use, but even worse: It's not downloadable from Microsoft (at least not in September 2020). 

It should be located here: "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=75742", but this resultet in a 404.

You can still find these files on the internet from strange sites and shipped in a .exe file. That's why I decided to put up those files here.

# How to use it:

The tool itself __can run unter a x64 Windows 10 and works with Office 365__.

You need to use the __cmd.exe__ from the __C:\Windows\SysWOW64__ folder, then run the "CreateHash.bat" and follow the instructions.

So - have fun!
